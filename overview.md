# Project Overview

This project aims to build a graph-based AI system that predicts early signs of underperformance among individuals in education or organizational contexts.

The system is designed to:
- Represent people, tasks, projects, and signals in a knowledge graph
- Compute risk levels (low, medium, high)
- Provide explainable reasons for each prediction
- Suggest interventions for support

This document will be expanded as development progresses.
